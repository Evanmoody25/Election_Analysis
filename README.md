# Deliverable 3

The purpose of this election audit analysis is to breakdown the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county. Then use this data 
to find a winner of the election, as well as to introduce python to individuals who may be new to the program. 

Results: 
In this congressional election, 369,711 votes were caste.

Breaking down the votes per county in the precinct, 

-Jefferson had 38,855 voters turnout and that was 10.5% of total turnout accross counties. 

-Denver had 306,055 voters turnout and this was 82.8% of total turnout accross counties. Denver had the largest number of votes.

-Arapahoe had 24,801 voters turnout and thas was 6.7% of total turnout. 

Breaking down the votes per candidate, 

-Charles Casper Stockham had 85,213 votes which covered 23.0% of total votes. 

-Diana DeGette had 272,892 votes which covered 73.8% of the vote. 

-Raymon Anthony Doane had 11,606 votes which covered 3.1% of the vote. 

-Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes which is, again, 73.8% of the vote. 

How can this script be used in future elections? 

By loading in new data for python to read and changing some of the names you could run this code again without too may problemes. If there are more or less candidates the 
code would already be there to loope through them. You would just need the data to be in a similat csv file for optimal effect but you could still rework it if you needed to
without too much struggle.
